  abstract      = "As there are as many clients as many usages of an Image
                  Processing library, each one may expect different services
                  from it. Some clients may look for efficient and
                  production-quality algorithms, some may look for a large tool
                  set, while others may look for extensibility and genericity to
                  inter-operate with their own code base...but in most cases,
                  they want a simple-to-use and stable product. For a C++ Image
                  Processing library designer, it is difficult to conciliate
                  genericity, efficiency and simplicity at the same time. Modern
                  C++ (post 2011) brings new features for library developers
                  that will help designing a software solution combining those
                  three points. In this paper, we develop a method using these
                  facilities to abstract the library components and augment the
                  genericity of the algorithms. Furthermore, this method is not
                  specific to image processing; it can be applied to any C++
                  scientific library.",

  abstract     = {C++ is a multi-paradigm language that enables the programmer to set up efficient image processing
                  algorithms easily. This language strength comes from many aspects. C++ is high-level, so this enables
                  developing powerful abstractions and mixing different programming styles to ease the development. At
                  the same time, C++ is low-level and can fully take advantage of the hardware to deliver the best
                  performance. It is also very portable and highly compatible which allows algorithms to be called from
                  high-level, fast-prototyping languages such as Python or Matlab. One fundamental aspects where C++
                  shines is generic programming. Generic programming makes it possible to develop and reuse bricks of
                  software on objects (images) of different natures (types) without performance loss. Nevertheless,
                  conciliating genericity, efficiency, and simplicity at the same time is not trivial. Modern C++
                  (post-2011) has brought new features that made it simpler and more powerful. In this paper, we focus
                  on some C++20 aspects of generic programming: ranges, views, and concepts, and see how they extend to
                  images to ease the development of generic image algorithms while lowering the computation time.},
