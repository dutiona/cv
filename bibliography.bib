  abstract  = {As there are as many clients as many usages of an Image Processing library, each one may expect
               different services from it. Some clients may look for efficient and production-quality algorithms, some
               may look for a large tool set, while others may look for extensibility and genericity to inter-operate
               with their own code base...but in most cases, they want a simple-to-use and stable product. For a C++
               Image Processing library designer, it is difficult to conciliate genericity, efficiency and simplicity at
               the same time. Modern C++ (post 2011) brings new features for library developers that will help designing
               a software solution combining those three points. In this paper, we develop a method using these
               facilities to abstract the library components and augment the genericity of the algorithms. Furthermore,
               this method is not specific to image processing; it can be applied to any C++ scientific library.},

                  on some C++20 aspects of generic programming: ranges, views, and concepts, and see how they extend to
                  images to ease the development of generic image algorithms while lowering the computation time.},

  abstract = {C++ is a multi-paradigm language that enables the initiated programmer to set up efficient image
              processing algorithms. This language strength comes from several aspects. C++ is high-level, which

              At the same time, C++ is low-level and can fully take advantage of the hardware to deliver the best

              where ++ really shines is generic programming. Generic programming makes it possible to develop and reuse

              we first explore one particular C++20 aspect: the concepts, in order to build a concrete taxonomy of image
              related types and algorithms. Second, we explore another addition to C++20, ranges (and views), and we
              apply this design to image processing algorithms and image types in order to solve issues such as how
              hard it is to customize/tweak image processing algorithms. Finally, we explore possibilities regarding
              how we can offer a bridge betweenstatic (compile-time) generic C++ code and dynamic (runtime) Python
              code. We offer our own hybrid solution and benchmark its performance as well as discuss what can be done
              in the future with JIT technologies. Considering those three axes, we will address the issue regarding
              the way to conciliate generic programming, efficiency and ease of use.},
